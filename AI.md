Commit c0bc342 Refactoring Storage Class: 
1. Which tool you used for which increment:
I used Chatgpt to assist in refactoring my code and improving my code quality
2. Interesting observations (e.g., what worked? what didn't?)
It helped me to quickly reduce slap and also check for malformed lines
However, it did not completely fill in the magic number issue as I liked as 
it probably did not understand my context enough, so I had to name them myself
3. Overall, how much time did it save
Saved a few minutes per coding task
